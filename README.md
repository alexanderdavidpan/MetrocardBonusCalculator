# Metrocard Bonus Calculator

## About

I began programming a year ago as a hobby. This is the first project that I ever built. Please be kind.

Metrocard Bonus Calculator was inspired by [NYC Metrocard Bonus Calculator](http://www.panix.com/~steveo/cgi/metrocard_bonus_calc.html) and [NYC Metrocard Bonus Calculator](http://www.nycmetrocardcalculator.com/).

This programs takes the amount of money left on a user's Metrocard and the maximum amount of money that they are willing to spend. Then it calculates all possibilities of amounts that can be purchased so the user ends up with an even number of rides after the 5% bonus is applied.
